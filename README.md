Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools, to develop and maintain high-quality Software systems. 
It plays a vital role in the technology industry as it is used to create applications and systems that are used throughout all industries.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The creation of Fortran in 1957 by John Backus, used in but not limited to, scientific computing and engineering 
In the 1960s, Software Engineering was established as a discipline. This meant it was recognised as a career path.
In the 1970s, well-structured and concise programming was adopted.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: identifying and noting a need for a certain system by users.
Design: creating high-level and detailed design for the architecture and user interface.
Implementation: creation of the software based on design specification.
Testing: conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: providing support, continuous updates and enhancing user experience.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is more of a chronological approach with strict steps to be followed.
Whereas Agile is more flexible, with a take-it-as-it-comes and adaptive approach. 
Key difference is flexibility, Agile is more flexible, allowing collaboration, whereas Waterfall is rigid. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: responsible for writing code.

Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality and testing functionality.

 Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software project.
 
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs: software suites that provide tools for coding, debugging and testing code.(eg. Visual Studio)
 VCS: Used to track changes to source code and coordination amongst team members(eg. Github)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines and Technical Debt. Strategies for overcoming challenges are communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the crafting of questions in such a way that ensures the best response from an AI model. Prompt Engineering helps avoid getting unclear and unspecific responses, effectively helping you get more out if the AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague: "Tell me about Africa"
Clear: "Tell me the history of Africa, all the Kingdoms that reigned"
